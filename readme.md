# Python Playground


## A Collection of Code, Impractical Logic Problems, and (obviously) Spam

This project `might be` for the un-initiated wiery code slinger who just wants 
cliff notes on random Python modules, syntax & language constructs, and obscure  *flying circus* reference!  

As it happens, I'm that aforementioned and thought it a good idea to try and capture some
\(if only a minuscule amount\) useful information while on this sojourn.  Thus a repo emerged replete with runnable code and witty inner-monolog.  


## Python and Machine Learning

So what brought me to this state of affairs were steps along the Machine Learning "journey of a thousand" intrigues and diversions. 

Turned out much of that technology is dependent on Python and its katana wielding - number crunching - data slicing technologies like PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy and so on. My advice, Python is required kungfu if planning to tame the Machine Learning AI tiger. 

I'll include code and command examples specific to my experience with Python, datasets and training models.


## In Summary

As this old dog learns new Python tricks that codify into unforgettable coding pearls of wisdom, they'll be added. And if you're feeling generous and want to contribute, fork that branch and create a pull request with gems of your own.

And know that I'm grateful to all who freely contribute to projects, forums, talks shows, knitting circles, and trampoline competitions.  Without your open source thinking and generous donation of time, I'd probably be reading books and watching HOWTOs right now. Thank You. Seriously!


## Role Credits

Python (for real) is made possible by you and the generous support of references like these: 
### [Real Python](https://realpython.com) : they won't publish any of that fake stuff!

### [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org) : hours of fun and safe as running with scissors!

### [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) : all self-identifying logarithms and exponents are welcome. But sine and cosine, you're straight out!
