# Python Playground


## A Collection of Code, Impractical Logic Problems, and (obviously) Spam

This project `might be` for the un-initiated wiery code slinger who just wants 
cliff notes on random Python modules, syntax & language constructs, and obscure  *flying circus* reference!  

As it happens, I'm that aforementioned and thought it a good idea to try and capture some
\(if only a minuscule amount\) useful information while on this sojourn.  Thus a repo immerged, replete with runnable code peppered in witty inner-monolog.  


## Python and Machine Learning

Yeah, now I have your attention.  So what brought me to this state of affairs was another journey "of a thousands steps". Which as the subtitle suggest, was Machine Learning and Large Language Model training. 

Turned out much of that technology is dependent on Python too and its katana wielding - number crunching - data slicing frameworks PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, etc.

 Python is required kungfu if you intent to tame that tiger. Code examples specific to dataset and training models are included as well.


## In Summary

Allow me to summarize. As this old dog learns new Python tricks, I'll add code examples as time allows. If you're feeling generous and want to contribute, fork that branch and create a pull request. 

I'm grateful to any who freely contribute to projects, forums, talks shows, knitting clubs, and professional media outlets.  Without your open source thinking and generous time-gift, I'd probably be reading books and watching HOWTOs. Thanks You. Seriously.


## Role Credits

Python (for real) is made possible by you and the generous support of references like these: 
### [Real Python](https://realpython.com) : they won't publish any of that fake stuff!

### [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org) : hours of fun and safe as running with scissors!

### [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) : all self-identifying logarithms and exponents are welcome. But sine and cosine, you're straight out!
